//: ## Variables Exercises
//: In these exercises, you will create variables and constants, and you will handle simple compiler areas that arise when working with them.
/*:
### Exercise 1

For each of the following names and types, create a variables or constant that best represents it:

- boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius (Double)
- gallonsRemainingInTank (Double)
- naturalLogarithmicBase (Double)
- ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (Int)
- studentNickname (String)
*/

/*
let boilingPointOfWaterInCelsius = 100.00
var gallonsRemainingInTank = 6.25
let naturalLogarithmicBase = 3.14
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 5
let studentNickname = "Buddy"

*/



//: ### Exercise 2
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants:
let favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
var gallonsRemainingInTank = 6.25
var ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32.45
let numberOfGasIcons: Int = 8
var numberOfPolygonsInModel = 30
numberOfPolygonsInModel = 32
var polygonsLeftToDraw = 0
polygonsLeftToDraw = numberOfPolygonsInModel

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Fix the following compiler errors related to invalid names:
var nameOfSchool = "Udacity"
var subject = "Math"
let type = "Nissian"
var 🐩myDog = "🐶"
var 🐕yourDog = "🐶"
